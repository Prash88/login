This is my attempt at a quickstart for Pagoda Box, using [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) 2.1.3, [TankAuth](http://konyukhov.com/soft/tank_auth/) 1.0.9, and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) 2.1.1.

It should give you running start with a framework and some authentication and an excellent off-the-shelf front end.
